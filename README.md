Deep Learning Project on Fingerprint prediction using finger images

In this project we have three main parts
1) Convolutional Neural Network architecture to learn and predict the fingerprint of a given finger image.
2) Custom camera android app to collect data for training and testing of the CNN model.
3) FingerPrintPredict android app to test our CNN on an android device. It takes a picture of a finger and shows the predicted output.
