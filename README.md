# HCI-DeepLearning
Project on Fingerprint prediction using Deep learning

In this project we have three main parts
1) Deep learning Convolutional Neural Network to learn and predict the fingerprint of a given finger image.
2) Custom camera android app to collect data for training and testing of CNN.
3) FingerPrintPredict android app to test our CNN on an android device. It takes a picture of a finger and shows the predicted output.
